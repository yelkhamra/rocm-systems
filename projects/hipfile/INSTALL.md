# Install guide for hipFile

## Quick Install Guide

hipFile depends on ROCm 7.2.x or greater. TheRock technology preview releases (e.g. 7.9) may not be based on the 7.2 release and may not support hipFile. Install ROCm and amdgpu-dkms, as described in the [ROCm quick start installation guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html).

On Ubuntu 24.04, the installation process is as follows. First, install a couple of needed packages.

```
sudo apt install libmount-dev wget
```

Then, install the nightly hipFile packages.

```
wget https://github.com/ROCm/hipFile/releases/download/nightly/hipfile_0.2.0.70200-nightly.9999.24.04_amd64.deb
wget https://github.com/ROCm/hipFile/releases/download/nightly/hipfile-dev_0.2.0.70200-nightly.9999.24.04_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i hipfile-dev_0.2.0.70200-nightly.9999.24.04_amd64.deb hipfile_0.2.0.70200-nightly.9999.24.04_amd64.deb
```

We can verify that the HIP libraries and kernel support AIS by running ais-check.

```
/opt/rocm/bin/ais-check
```

Successful output from ais-check will show True for several checks:

```
AIS support in:
        Kernel P2PDMA support   : True
        HIP runtime             : True
        amdgpu                  : True
```

hipFile currently works on local NVMe disks. To set up a new NVMe device we can partition it, create a filesystem on the partition, and mount it. Below we use the device `/dev/nvme1n1`. Make sure you use the correct device in your system.

```
sudo apt install gdisk
# Add partition spanning entire device
sudo sgdisk -n 1:0:0 /dev/nvme1n1
# Create and mount filesystem
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme1n1p1
sudo mkdir /mnt/ext4
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/ext4 -o data=ordered
# Create directory accessible by current user
sudo mkdir /mnt/ext4/"$USER"
sudo chown "$USER": /mnt/ext4/"$USER"
```

Now, we can download and compile the aiscp test program.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/hipFile/refs/heads/develop/examples/aiscp/aiscp.cpp
amdclang++ -D__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ -L/opt/rocm/lib -I/opt/rocm/include -lamdhip64 -lhipfile aiscp.cpp -o aiscp
```

To verify the fast path is working, copy a file with compatibility mode disabled. This should run successfully if the source and destination paths are on filesystems supporting `O_DIRECT`.

```
# Create a random input file
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/ext4/"$USER"/source bs=4K count=16
# Copy file
HIPFILE_ALLOW_COMPAT_MODE=false ./aiscp /mnt/ext4/"$USER"/source /mnt/ext4/"$USER"/dest
md5sum /mnt/ext4/"$USER"/source /mnt/ext4/"$USER"/dest
```

## Building hipFile

> [!NOTE]
> hipFile is alpha software that has undergone testing on limited hardware. It may not work on your system at this time.

Supported hardware:
* hipFile should work with the [GPUs that ROCm supports](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html)
* Storage is currently limited to local NVMe drives
* hipFile has only been tested on AMD CPUs/systems

Supported compilers: amdclang++ (preferred), clang++, g++

If CMake can't find hipcc/nvcc, you can set `-DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=<path>`

Supported platforms: Linux (Windows may be supported in a future release)

Supported filesystems: Only ext4 and xfs are supported at this time. ext4 must be mounted with the default data=ordered mount option.

Targeting NVIDIA requires cuFile to be installed

The kernel must have `CONFIG_PCI_P2PDMA` enabled

Multipath NVMe devices are not supported at this time. If you are using a multipath-supporting device, you may need to disable multipath in the nvme\_core kernel driver. On Ubuntu 24.04, this can be done by running the following:

```
sudo bash -c 'echo "options nvme_core multipath=N" > /etc/modprobe.d/nvme_core.conf'
sudo update-initramfs -c -k all
sudo systemctl reboot
```

### Prerequisites

#### Build Tools
* CMake >= 3.21
* C++ >= 17 (tested w/ clang++ & g++, we don't use GNU extensions)
* The `ais-check` tool requires Python >= 3.6
* The hipFile Python bindings require Python >= 3.10

#### AMD Components
* ROCm >= 7.2.x
    * `hip-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu)
    * `hip-devel` (RHEL/Fedora/openSUSE)
* amdgpu-dkms >= 30.20.1

#### Other Packages
* Boost.Program\_options
    * `libboost-program-options-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu)
    * `libboost-program-options-devel` (RHEL/Fedora/openSUSE)
* libmount
    * `libmount-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu)
    * `libmount-devel` (RHEL/Fedora/openSUSE)

### Configure

You do not need to set the `HIP_PLATFORM` environment variable, as
that will be set by CMake.

`cmake -DCMAKE_HIP_PLATFORM=(amd|nvidia) <options> <path/to/source>`

Options
|Option|Default|Purpose|
|------|-------|-------|
|AIS\_BUILD\_DOCS|OFF|Build API documentation (requires Doxygen)|
|AIS\_INSTALL\_EXAMPLES|ON|Install example programs|
|AIS\_USE\_CLANG\_TIDY|OFF|Run the `clang-tidy` tool (clang only)|
|AIS\_USE\_CODE\_COVERAGE|OFF|Generate code coverage information when tests are run (clang only)|
|AIS\_USE\_IWYU|OFF|Run the `include-what-you-use` tool (clang only)|
|AIS\_WARN\_UNSAFE\_BUFFER\_OPS|ON|Scan code for unsafe buffer operations (clang only, OFF for others)|

Sanitizer options (clang only)
|Option|Default|Purpose|
|------|-------|-------|
|AIS\_USE\_SANITIZERS|OFF|Build with -fsanitize=address,float-divide-by-zero,integer,leak,local-bounds,nullability,undefined,vptr|
|AIS\_USE\_THREAD\_SANITIZER|OFF|Build with -fsanitize=thread (not compatible with AIS\_USE\_SANITIZERS)|

### Build
`cmake --build .`

### Run tests

`ctest .` will run all tests.

You can filter on test labels using the `-L` option. We currently have `hipfile` and `internal` labels for the public API and its internals, respectively, and `unit`, `system`, and `stress` labels for the different test types. Multiple `-L` options form an *and*. A `|` can be used for an *or*.

`ctest . -L internal -L unit` runs all the internal library unit tests.
`ctest . -L 'system|unit'` runs all system or unit tests.

You can filter on test names using the `-R` option. This option supports wildcards.

`ctest . -R HipFileBuffer.get_buffer_makes_temporary_buffer` runs the specified test.
`ctest . -R 'HipFileBuffer*'` runs all tests that start with HipFileBuffer.

### Install and package
The hipFile library can be installed with CMake. The default
install prefix is still the CMake default of `/usr/local`.

`cmake --install .`

The libraries can also be packaged with CPack. .rpm, .deb. and .tar.gz
are all supported.

`cpack -G RPM`
`cpack -G DEB`
`cpack -G TGZ`

### Code coverage
The same version of Clang and LLVM must be used in order to generate
coverage results. `rocm-llvm-dev` can be installed to get the LLVM
version matching amdclang++.

PATH may need to be adjusted depending on the system configuration. The
following will add the default ROCm version of the tools to the path.
```
export PATH=/opt/rocm/bin:/opt/rocm/llvm/bin:"$PATH"
```

To generate code coverage information, the `AIS_USE_CODE_COVERAGE`
flag must be enabled when configuring. Run the build and test steps,
then run the following to generate the summaries.
```
<path/to/repo>/util/llvm-coverage.sh
```

The results will be wrote to `<path/to/repo>/build`, in the
`coverage-report.txt` and `coverage-lines.txt` files.

### Documentation
The API documentation is built using Doxygen. To build it, use the
`AIS_BUILD_DOCS` option. This will build the documentation for any
libraries that have been configured. As a special case, configuring
the documentation without any library will build the documentation
for BOTH libraries, allowing for a docs-only build.

The documentation will be built with the libraries and appear in
`docs/(hip|roc)file`. We build HTML, XML, and LaTeX docs. If you
want a pdf, run `make pdf` in the `latex` directory, which will
create a file named refman.pdf that you can rename.

If you want to build the docs without compiling the libraries,
you can just build the `doc` target (if you've set `AIS_BUILD_DOCS`):

    `cmake --build . --target doc`
