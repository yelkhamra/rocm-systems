# cannot be modified directly, so resolve to the underlying target first. We
# use set_property(... APPEND ...) rather than target_link_libraries() so this
# works uniformly for the IMPORTED targets that a system find_package(GTest)
# produces as well as the normal targets from a fetched build. A system GTest
# install may provide gtest without gmock, so only touch targets that exist.
#
# A from-source GoogleTest already links Threads::Threads on its targets, so
# check before appending to avoid a duplicate entry in the link interface.
