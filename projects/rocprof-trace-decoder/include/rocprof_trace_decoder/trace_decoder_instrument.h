/**
 * This file describes the instrumentation format for rocprof trace decoder 0.1.5.
 * Instrumentation is optional for decoding, with the exception of
 * rocprof_trace_decoder_gfx9_header_t. Unless specified, all instrumentation packets are written to
 * the USERDATA2 register. This is an experimental feature, and as such the instrumentation may be
 * changed without notice.
 *
 * It is recommended to use code object instrumentation for long traces, to avoid overlapping
 * address spaces if code objects are loaded/unloaded during the trace. When an ID is found,
 * callbacks involving _trace_decoder_pc_t will return {id, vaddr} instead of {0, memory_address}.
