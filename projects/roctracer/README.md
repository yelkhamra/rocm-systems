# ROC-tracer

> [!IMPORTANT]
ROCTracer, [ROCProfiler](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler/en/latest/index.html), `rocprof`, and `rocprofv2` are deprecated. It's strongly recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the [ROCprofiler-SDK](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/install/installation.html) library and the [rocprofv3](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/how-to/using-rocprofv3.html) tool to ensure continued support and access to new features.
To learn about key feature improvements and benefits of ROCprofiler-SDK over the deprecated ROCProfiler and ROCTracer, see [Comparing ROCprofiler-SDK to legacy ROCm profiling tools](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/conceptual/comparing-with-legacy-tools.html).
It's anticipated that ROCTracer, ROCProfiler, `rocprof`, and `rocprofv2` will reach end of support (EoS) by the end of 2026 Q2.

- **ROC-tracer library: Runtimes Generic Callback/Activity APIs**

  The goal of the implementation is to provide a generic independent from specific runtime profiler to trace API and asynchronous activity.

  The API provides functionality for registering the runtimes API callbacks and asynchronous activity records pool support.

- **ROC-TX library: Code Annotation Events API**

  Includes API for:

  - `roctxMark`
  - `roctxRangePush`
  - `roctxRangePop`

## Usage

### `rocTracer` API

To use the rocTracer API you need the API header and to link your application with `roctracer` .so library:

- `/opt/rocm/include/roctracer/roctracer.h`

  API header.

- `/opt/rocm/lib/libroctracer64.so`

  .so library.

### `rocTX` API

To use the rocTX API you need the API header and to link your application with `roctx` .so library:

- `/opt/rocm/include/roctracer/roctx.h`

  API header.

- `/opt/rocm/lib/libroctx64.so`

  .so library.

## Build and run tests

- ROCm is required

- Packages required:

  1. For Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   apt install python3 python3-pip gcc g++ libatomic1 make rocm-llvm-dev \
    cmake doxygen graphviz texlive-full
   ````

  2. For CentOS 8.1 and RHEL 8.1 the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   yum install -y python3 python3-pip gcc gcc-g++ make rocm-llvm-devel \
    cmake libatomic doxygen graphviz texlive \
    texlive-xtab texlive-multirow texlive-sectsty \
    texlive-tocloft texlive-tabu texlive-adjustbox
   ````

  3. For SLES 15 Service Pack 15 the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
