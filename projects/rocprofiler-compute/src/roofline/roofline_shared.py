"""Roofline plot/client values shared between Python and the browser.

Single source of truth for anything the Python figure builder
and the client assets must agree on.
Values needed by the browser are forwarded through
RooflineViewModel.to_json() rather than being re-hardcoded, so a
value only ever changes here.

Pure calc-math constants live with
the ceiling math in utils.roofline_calc instead; this module only holds the
plot/UI contract.
