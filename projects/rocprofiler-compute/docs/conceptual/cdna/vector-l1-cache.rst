**********************
Vector L1 cache (vL1D)
**********************

The vector L1 data (vL1D) cache is local to each
:doc:`compute unit <compute-unit>` on the accelerator, and handles vector memory
operations issued by a wavefront. The vL1D cache consists of several components:

* An address processing unit, also known as the
  :ref:`texture addresser <desc-ta>` which receives commands (instructions) and
  write/atomic data from the :doc:`compute unit <compute-unit>`, and coalesces
  them into fewer requests for the cache to process.

* An address translation unit, also known as the
  :ref:`L1 Unified Translation Cache (UTCL1) <desc-utcl1>`, that translates
  requests from virtual to physical addresses for lookup in the cache. The
  translation unit has an L1 translation lookaside buffer (L1TLB) to reduce the
  cost of repeated translations.

* A Tag RAM that looks up whether a requested cache line is already
  present in the :ref:`cache <desc-tc>`.

* The result of the Tag RAM lookup is placed in the L1 cache controller
  for routing to the correct location; for instance, the
  :ref:`L2 Memory Interface <vl1d-l2-transaction-detail>` for misses or the
  :ref:`cache RAM <desc-tc>` for hits.

* The cache RAM, also known as the :ref:`texture cache (TC) <desc-tc>`, stores
  requested data for potential reuse. Data returned from the
  :doc:`L2 cache <l2-cache>` is placed into the cache RAM before going down the
  :ref:`data-return path <desc-td>`.

* A backend data processing unit, also known as the
  :ref:`texture data (TD) <desc-td>` that routes data back to the requesting
  :doc:`compute unit <compute-unit>`.

Together, this complex is known as the vL1D, or Texture Cache per Pipe
(TCP). A simplified diagram of the vL1D is presented below:

vL1D Speed-of-Light
===================

.. warning::

   The theoretical maximum throughput for some metrics in this section are
   currently computed with the maximum achievable clock frequency, as reported
   by ``rocminfo``, for an accelerator. This may not be realistic for all
   workloads.

The vL1D’s speed-of-light chart shows several key metrics for the vL1D
as a comparison with the peak achievable values of those metrics.

.. _desc-ta:

Address processing unit or Texture Addresser (TA)
=================================================

The :doc:`vL1D <vector-l1-cache>`’s address processing unit receives vector
memory instructions (commands) along with write/atomic data from a
:doc:`compute unit <compute-unit>` and is responsible for coalescing these into
requests for lookup in the :ref:`vL1D RAM <desc-tc>`. The address processor
passes information about the commands (coalescing state, destination SIMD,
etc.) to the :ref:`data processing unit <desc-td>` for use after the requested
data has been retrieved.

ROCm Compute Profiler reports several metrics to indicate performance bottlenecks in
the address processing unit, which are broken down into a few
categories:

-  :ref:`ta-busy-stall`

-  :ref:`ta-instruction-counts`

-  :ref:`ta-spill-stack`

.. _ta-busy-stall:

Busy / stall metrics
--------------------

When executing vector memory instructions, the compute unit must send an
address (and in the case of writes/atomics, data) to the address
processing unit. When the front-end cannot accept any more addresses, it
must backpressure the wave-issue logic for the VMEM pipe and prevent the
issue of further vector memory instructions.

         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

.. _ta-instruction-counts:

Instruction counts
------------------

The address processor also counts instruction types to give the user
information on what sorts of memory instructions were executed by the
kernel. These are broken down into a few major categories:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Memory type

     - Usage

     - Description

   * - Global

     - Global memory

     - Global memory can be seen by all threads from a process. This includes
       the local accelerator's DRAM, remote accelerator's DRAM, and the host's
       DRAM.

   * - Generic

     - Dynamic address spaces

     - Generic memory, or "flat" memory, is used when the compiler cannot
       statically prove that a pointer is to memory in one or the other address
       spaces. The pointer could dynamically point into global, local, constant,
       or private memory.

   * - Private Memory

     - Register spills / Stack memory

     - Private memory, or "scratch" memory, is only visible to a particular
       :ref:`work-item <desc-work-item>` in a particular
       :ref:`workgroup <desc-workgroup>`. On AMD Instinct™ MI-series
       accelerators, private memory is used to implement both register spills
       and stack memory accesses.

The address processor counts these instruction types as follows:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: CDNA

      .. jinja:: ta-instruction-counts-gfx908
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

   .. tab-item:: CDNA 2

      .. jinja:: ta-instruction-counts-gfx90a
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

   .. tab-item:: CDNA 3

      .. jinja:: ta-instruction-counts-gfx942
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

   .. tab-item:: CDNA 4
      :selected:

      .. jinja:: ta-instruction-counts-gfx950
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

.. note::

   The above is a simplified model specifically for the HIP programming language
   that does not consider inline assembly usage, constant memory usage or
   texture memory.

   These categories correspond to:

   * Global/Generic: global and flat memory operations, that are used for global
     and generic memory access.

   * Spill/Stack: buffer instructions which are used on the MI100, and
     :ref:`MI2XX <mixxx-note>` accelerators for register spills / stack memory.

   These concepts are described in more detail in the :ref:`memory-spaces`,
   while generic memory access is explored in the
   :ref:`generic memory benchmark <flat-memory-ex>` section.

.. _ta-spill-stack:

Spill / stack metrics
---------------------

Finally, the address processing unit contains a separate coalescing
stage for spill/stack memory, and thus reports:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: CDNA

      .. jinja:: ta-spill-stack-gfx908
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

      :selected:

      .. jinja:: ta-spill-stack-gfx950
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

.. _desc-utcl1:

L1 Unified Translation Cache (UTCL1)
====================================

After a vector memory instruction has been processed/coalesced by the
address processing unit of the vL1D, it must be translated from a
virtual to physical address. This process is handled by the L1 Unified
Translation Cache (UTCL1). This cache contains a L1 Translation
Lookaside Buffer (TLB) which stores recently translated addresses to
reduce the cost of subsequent re-translations.

ROCm Compute Profiler reports the following L1 TLB metrics:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: CDNA

      .. jinja:: desc-utcl1-gfx908
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

   .. tab-item:: CDNA 2

      .. jinja:: desc-utcl1-gfx90a
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

   .. tab-item:: CDNA 3

      .. jinja:: desc-utcl1-gfx942
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

   .. tab-item:: CDNA 4
      :selected:

      .. jinja:: desc-utcl1-gfx950
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

.. note::

   On current CDNA accelerators, such as the :ref:`MI2XX <mixxx-note>`, the
   UTCL1 does *not* count hit-on-miss requests.

.. _desc-tc:

Vector L1 Cache RAM or Texture Cache (TC)
=========================================

After coalescing in the :ref:`address processing unit <desc-ta>` of the v1LD,
and address translation in the :ref:`L1 TLB <desc-utcl1>` the request proceeds
to the Cache RAM stage of the pipeline. Incoming requests are looked up
in the cache RAMs using parts of the physical address as a tag. Hits
will be returned through the :ref:`data-return path <desc-td>`, while misses
will routed out to the :doc:`L2 Cache <l2-cache>` for servicing.

The metrics tracked by the vL1D RAM include:

-  :ref:`Stall metrics <vl1d-cache-stall-metrics>`

-  :ref:`Cache access metrics <vl1d-cache-access-metrics>`

-  :ref:`vL1D-L2 transaction detail metrics <vl1d-l2-transaction-detail>`

.. _vl1d-cache-stall-metrics:

vL1D cache stall metrics
------------------------

The vL1D also reports where it is stalled in the pipeline, which may
indicate performance limiters of the cache. A stall in the pipeline may
result in backpressuring earlier parts of the pipeline, e.g., a stall on
L2 requests may backpressure the wave-issue logic of the :ref:`VMEM <desc-vmem>`
pipe and prevent it from issuing more vector memory instructions until
the vL1D’s outstanding requests are completed.

.. _vl1d-cache-access-metrics:

vL1D cache access metrics
-------------------------

The vL1D cache access metrics broadly indicate the type of requests
incoming from the :ref:`cache front-end <desc-ta>`, the number of requests that
were serviced by the vL1D, and the number & type of outgoing requests to
the :doc:`L2 cache <l2-cache>`. In addition, this section includes the
approximate latencies of accesses to the cache itself, along with
latencies of read/write memory operations to the :doc:`L2 cache <l2-cache>`.

      :selected:

      .. jinja:: vl1d-cache-access-metrics-gfx950
         :file: _templates/metrics_table.j2

.. note::

   All cache accesses in vL1D are for a single cache line's worth of data.
   The size of a cache line may vary, however on current AMD Instinct MI CDNA
   accelerators and GCN™ GPUs the L1 cache line size is 64B.

.. rubric :: Footnotes

.. [#vl1d-hit] The vL1D cache on AMD Instinct MI-series CDNA accelerators
   uses a "hit-on-miss" approach to reporting cache hits. That is, if while
   satisfying a miss, another request comes in that would hit on the same
   pending cache line, the subsequent request will be counted as a "hit".
   Therefore, it is also important to consider the access latency metric in the
   :ref:`Cache access metrics <vl1d-cache-stall-metrics>` section when
   evaluating the vL1D hit rate.

.. [#vl1d-activity] ROCm Compute Profiler considers the vL1D to be active when any part of
   the vL1D (excluding the :ref:`address processor <desc-ta>` and
   :ref:`data return <desc-td>` units) are active, for example, when performing
   a translation, waiting for data, accessing the Tag or Cache RAMs, etc.

.. _vl1d-l2-transaction-detail:

vL1D - L2 Transaction Detail
----------------------------

This section provides a more granular look at the types of requests made
to the :doc:`L2 cache <l2-cache>`. These are broken down by the operation type
(read / write / atomic, with, or without return), and the
:ref:`memory type <memory-type>`.

.. _desc-td:

Vector L1 data-return path or Texture Data (TD)
===============================================

The data-return path of the vL1D cache, also known as the Texture Data
(TD) unit, is responsible for routing data returned from the
:ref:`vL1D cache RAM <desc-tc>` back to a wavefront on a SIMD. As described in
the :ref:`vL1D cache front-end <desc-ta>` section, the data-return path is passed
information about the space requirements and routing for data requests
from the :ref:`VALU <desc-valu>`. When data is returned from the
:ref:`vL1D cache RAM <desc-tc>`, it is matched to this previously stored request
data, and returned to the appropriate SIMD.

ROCm Compute Profiler reports the following vL1D data-return path metrics:
