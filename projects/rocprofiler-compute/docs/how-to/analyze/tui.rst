****************************************
Text-based User Interface (TUI) analysis
****************************************

ROCm Compute Profiler's analyze mode now supports a lightweight Text-based User Interface (TUI)
that provides an interactive terminal experience for enhanced usability. You can use the TUI
interface as a more visually engaging and interactive alternative to explore individual kernel analysis
results compared to the standard :doc:`cli`. It provides enhanced visual feedback and easy navigation
without needing the extra setup of a full graphical interface. This analysis option is implemented as
a terminal-based interface that offers real-time visual feedback, keyboard shortcuts for common
actions, and improved readability with formatted output.

.. note::

   TUI is currently an experimental feature. You must include the ``--experimental`` flag to enable it.
   While functional, you may encounter minor issues or limitations.
   For the limitations identified, see :ref:`Current limitations <tui-limitation>`
   Running production workloads is not recommended.

Launch the TUI analyzer
----------------------------------

1. Use the ``--experimental --tui`` flags with the analysis command to launch the ROCm Compute Profiler TUI analyzer.
For example:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ rocprof-compute analyze --experimental --tui

2. To start the individual kernel analysis, use the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen to select
a single workload from ``rocprof-compute profile`` generated output directories.

3. You can see the center window update with a top header for kernel selection and collapsed contents beneath.
Select a kernel of interest to load the corresponding analysis results. The top kernel is selected by default.

4. After the analysis results are loaded, you can start interactive analysis with the detailed metrics by
expanding the collapsed contents to view tables, charts, and graphs, and visualizing the analysis data.
The TUI supports basic keyboard shortcuts, including quit application commands for easy navigation.

TUI analysis structure
----------------------------------

Unlike the :doc:`cli` plain style interfaces, the TUI restructures the analysis workflow into four
hierarchical categories to provide a more organized, top-down analysis approach:

#. Kernel Selection Header with Top Stats:

   Supports interactive kernel selection to toggle between kernel(s) to view individual kernel
   analysis results.

#. High Level Analysis:

   Experimental performance metrics layout, reorganized performance metrics grouping to display the new
   GPU Speed-of-Light section, Compute Throughput section, and Memory Throughput section.

#. Detailed Block Analysis

   Displays analysis results grouped by metric blocks, similar to the CLI output.
   When applicable, performance metrics are shown as charts instead of only tables,
   providing a more visual representation.

#. Source Level analysis

   Displays the PC Sampling section.
   Source Level analysis does not have PC sampling enabled by default during the
   profiling stage. Refer to :doc:`../pc_sampling` for details on how to build and enable PC sampling
   manually.

You are recommended to follow this top-down hierarchical structure to conduct a thorough performance
analysis, starting with the broad overview and progressively drilling down to specific details.

.. _tui-limitation:

Current limitations
----------------------------------
The TUI implementation has several limitations that will be addressed in future releases:

* **PC sampling**: Source Level analysis does not have PC sampling enabled by default during the
  profiling stage. Refer to :doc:`../pc_sampling` for details on how to build and enable PC sampling
  manually.

* **Filtering capabilities**: Advanced filtering options such as kernel filtering and dispatch
  filtering are currently not supported. These features will be available in upcoming releases.
