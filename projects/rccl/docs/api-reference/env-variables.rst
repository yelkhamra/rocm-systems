RCCL environment variables
********************************************************************

This section describes the most important RCCL environment variables,
which are grouped by functionality.

Configuration and setup
========================

The configuration and setup environment variables for RCCL are collected
in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_CONF_FILE``
        | Specifies the path to the RCCL configuration file.

        | Default: ``~/.rccl.conf`` or ``/etc/rccl.conf``

    * - | ``NCCL_HOSTID``
        | Sets the host identifier for multi-node communication.
      - | String value for host identification
        | Used for host hash generation

    * - | ``NCCL_BOOTSTRAP_BIDIR_ALLGATHER``
        | Enables the bidirectional ring AllGather (N/2 steps) on the socket OOB path

      - | ``0``: Force unidirectional ring.
        | ``1``: Force bidirectional ring (default).

    * - | ``NCCL_CUMEM_ENABLE``
        | Enables cuMem virtual memory management (VMM) for RCCL allocations,
          which is required for ``ncclCommSuspend`` and ``ncclCommResume`` to
          release the physical GPU memory of a suspended communicator. See
          :ref:`suspend-resume` for the full prerequisites.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled.
        | ``-2``: Auto-detect; enable when the platform supports VMM.

    * - | ``NCCL_MIN_CTAS``
        | Minimum number of CTAs (channels) used for a collective. Overrides
          the ``minCTAs`` field of ``ncclConfig_t``.
      - | Positive integer (values ``<= 0`` are ignored).
        | Default: unset (uses the RCCL default).

    * - | ``NCCL_MAX_CTAS``
        | Maximum number of CTAs (channels) used for a collective. Overrides
          the ``maxCTAs`` field of ``ncclConfig_t``.

        |
        | ``NONE``: No logging is printed.
        | ``ERROR``: These messages report when a fatal condition has occurred in RCCL and the operation can't continue.
        | ``VERSION``: ``librccl`` version info is printed during the initialization phase.
        | ``WARN``: Prints warnings about unusual conditions that could lead to unexpected results.
        | ``INFO``: Prints standard logging messages about status and operations performed.
        | ``ABORT``: Unused.
        | ``TRACE``: Prints trace-level logging of function calls and parameters. Only active when ``librccl`` is built using ``ENABLE_TRACE``.

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS``
        | Controls which subsystems generate debug output.
      - | These are the logging subsystems set via ``NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS``. These can be set as a comma-separated list, and can be inverted using the ``^`` prefix. The default subsystem set is ``INIT``, ``BOOTSTRAP``, and ``ENV``.
        |

        | ``ALL``: Activates all logging subsystems.

    * - | ``NCCL_WARN_ENABLE_DEBUG_INFO``
        | Converts all ``WARN`` level logs to ``INFO`` level logs.
      - | ``0``: Default value. Variable is not enabled.
        | ``1``: Enable the variable.

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_LEVELS``
        | The timestamp levels for ``NCCL_DEBUG``.
      - | A set of ``NCCL_DEBUG`` levels can have a timestamp prepended set as a comma-separated list which can be inverted using the ``^`` prefix. The default set is ``WARN``.

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT``
        | The timestamp format for ``NCCL_DEBUG``.

    * - | ``NCCL_DEBUG_FILE``
        | Write logs to a file rather than ``stdout``.
      - | The filename can be formatted using ``%h`` for hostname, ``%p`` for pid, and ``%%`` to escape the ``%`` character. It is recommended to use ``%p`` to output to individual files per pid to avoid mixing or potentially overwriting the output. Example usage: ``NCCL_DEBUG_FILE=debugfile.%h.%p``

Algorithm and protocol control
==============================

The algorithm and protocol control environment variables for RCCL are
collected in the following table.

.. list-table::

Network and topology
====================

The network and topology environment variables for RCCL are collected
in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_HCA``

      - | Device specification string
        | Prefix with ``^`` for exclusion, ``=`` for exact match

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX``
        | Defines the Global ID index used in RoCE mode.
      - | Integer value (default: ``-1``)
        | See InfiniBand ``show_gids`` command for valid values

    * - | ``NCCL_PXN_C2C``
        | Allows PXN routing through a C2C link to reach a NIC attached to a
          peer GPU. The C2C path is NVIDIA-specific and is not currently
          applicable on AMD hardware.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME``
        | Specifies which IP interfaces to use for communication.
      - | Interface prefix string or list
        | Multiple prefixes separated by ``,``
        | Prefix with ``^`` for exclusion, ``=`` for exact match

      - | ``AF_INET``: Force IPv4
        | ``AF_INET6``: Force IPv6
        | Unset: Use first available

    * - | ``NCCL_NET_MERGE_LEVEL``
        | Controls network device merging behavior.

    * - | ``NCCL_NETDEVS_POLICY``
        | Controls how many of a GPU's locally reachable NICs are used on the
        | network path for ``send``, ``recv``, and ``all-to-all``. The policy
        | governs per-channel NIC selection (``ncclTopoGetLocalNet``); the
        | per-peer network channel count is still bounded by available NIC
        | bandwidth.
        | Any unset, malformed, or out-of-range value falls back to ``AUTO``.
      - | ``AUTO`` (default): use ``ceil(localNetCount / localGpuCount)`` NICs,
        | dividing the local NICs across the GPUs that share them.
        | ``ALL``: use every locally reachable NIC.
        | ``MAX:N``: use at most ``N`` NICs (clamped to the number reachable);
        | ``N`` must be a positive integer.

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_THRESHOLD``
        | Minimum message size (in bytes) before the payload is split across
        | multiple NICs/QPs.
        | Smaller messages use one QP for data to reduce latency.
        | This variable can be leveraged when NIC Fusion (``NCCL_NET_MERGE_LEVEL``) and/or data splitting on QPs (``NCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_ON_QPS``) is enabled.
      - | Integer value in bytes (default: ``128``)
        | ``N``: Split only when message size >= N bytes

    * - | ``NCCL_RINGS``
        | Defines custom ring topology.

      - | Remapping specification string
        | Used with Rome 4P2H topology

QP scheduling (CAST)
==============================

CAST (Congestion aware sprayed traffic) adds a dynamic QP (Queue Pair) scheduler that
balances RDMA traffic across multiple QPs per connection based on measured
round-trip time (RTT). The following variables tune the scheduler. CAST-specific
variables are accessible with either the ``RCCL_`` or ``NCCL_`` prefix; the table
uses the ``RCCL_`` form where available (``NCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_ON_QPS`` has no
``RCCL_`` alias).

These variables only take effect when the CAST QP scheduler is active.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_ENABLE``
        | Enables the CAST QP scheduler.
      - | ``-1``: Auto (default). Enabled on most hardware, but disabled on
          AMD AINIC hardware unless overridden. Setting ``NCCL_NET=ib-cast`` also forces it on.
        | ``0``: Force off.
        | ``1``: Force on.

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_WRR_ENABLE``
        | Enables Weighted Round-Robin (WRR) scheduling within the QP scheduler.
      - | ``0``: Disabled.
        | ``1``: Enabled (default).

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_RESET_INTERVAL``
        | Interval at which accumulated RTT statistics are reset, to prevent
          stale samples from permanently biasing the scheduler. Value is in
          milliseconds.
      - | Integer milliseconds. Default: ``60000`` (60 seconds).
        | ``0``: Never reset.

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_UPDATE_INTERVAL``
        | Minimum interval between scheduler weight updates. Value is in
          microseconds.
      - | Integer microseconds. Default: ``50``.
        | Applied only for values in the range 1 µs to 60 s; out-of-range values are ignored.

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_WEIGHT``
        | Exponential moving average (EMA) weight applied to new RTT samples.
      - | Floating-point value in the range ``0`` to ``1.0``. Default: ``0``.
        | ``0``: Simple average.
        | Values closer to ``1.0`` react faster to recent samples.

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_SPLIT_DATA_MIN``
        | Minimum chunk size when splitting a message across QPs (split-data
          mode, enabled via ``NCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_ON_QPS``). Value is in bytes.
      - | Integer bytes. Default: ``65536``.
        | Only positive values are applied.

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_LOG_PATH``
        | Directory for per-QP scheduler log files (RTT samples, computed
          weights, token allocations). Log files are named
          ``cast_log_<hostname>_<pid>``.
      - | String directory path.
        | Default: unset (logging disabled).

    * - | ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_LOG_INTERVAL``
        | Interval at which scheduler statistics are written to the log file.
          Value is in microseconds. Only used when
          ``RCCL_IB_QP_SCHED_LOG_PATH`` is set.
      - | Integer microseconds. Default: ``1000000`` (1 second).
        | Applied only for values in the range 1 µs to 60 s; out-of-range values are ignored.

    * - | ``NCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_ON_QPS``
        | Selects how the scheduler distributes a message across QPs. When
          enabled, each message is split across QPs proportionally to their
          weights; when disabled, whole messages are assigned to QPs in a
          weighted round-robin pattern.
      - | ``0``: Round-robin whole messages (default).
        | ``1``: Split each message across QPs.

Development and testing (advanced)
==================================

The development and testing environment variables for RCCL are
collected in the following table. These variables are primarily
intended for debugging and development purposes.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING``
        | Controls CUDA kernel launch blocking behavior.
      - | ``0``: Non-blocking launches
        | ``1`` or non-zero: Blocking launches

    * - | ``NCCL_COMM_ID``
        | Enables multi-process mode in test applications.
      - | Any non-empty value enables multi-process mode
        | Used with test executables for distributed testing

    * - | ``NCCL_DISABLE_MEM_MANAGER``
        | Disables the internal RCCL memory manager. This is an internal
          parameter intended for testing and debugging only. When the memory
          manager is disabled, ``ncclCommSuspend``, ``ncclCommResume``, and
          ``ncclCommMemStats`` return ``ncclInvalidUsage``.
      - | ``0``: Memory manager enabled (default).
        | ``1``: Memory manager disabled.

    * - | ``NCCL_NO_CACHE``
        | Disables caching for selected RCCL environment parameters so their
          values are re-read from the environment on each access. By default,
          RCCL caches parameter values after the first read for performance.
          This variable is intended for testing and debugging when parameters
          need to be changed without restarting the process. The value is
          parsed once on first use, so it must be set before RCCL reads any
          parameters. ``NCCL_NO_CACHE`` itself is always cached and cannot
          be listed.
      - | Unset (default): all parameters are cached after first read.
        | Comma-separated list of parameter names (for example,
          ``NCCL_DEBUG,NCCL_ALGO``): disable caching for those keys only.
        | ``ALL``: disable caching for every parameter except
          ``NCCL_NO_CACHE``.

Multi-communicator ordering
===========================

When an application uses multiple RCCL communicators on the same device,
collective operations may execute in an unpredictable order unless the
application adds explicit synchronization between streams.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 40,60

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Values**

    * - | ``NCCL_LAUNCH_ORDER_IMPLICIT``
        | Serializes RCCL operations across different communicators on the
        | same device according to their host-side launch sequence. This
        | provides deterministic execution order for multi-communicator
        | workloads such as chained collectives where one operation's
        | output feeds into the next.
      - | ``0``: Disabled (default).
        | ``1``: Enabled. Operations execute in host launch order.
