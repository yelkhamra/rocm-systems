validate.py -- context stop/start independence between two tools.

Both Tool A (early, never stopped) and Tool B (late, stopped during phase B) trace
KERNEL_DISPATCH over the same streams. The proof of per-client context independence:

  * Tool B captured strictly fewer dispatches than Tool A (it missed the stopped window).
  * The dispatches B missed form a single CONTIGUOUS window in time (the stop/start
    window) -- i.e. B has one large internal timestamp gap.
  * Tool A captured dispatches INSIDE that window -- the work B dropped was still recorded
    by the tool that was never stopped.
