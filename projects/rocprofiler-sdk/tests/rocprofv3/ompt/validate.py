# OMPT is a rocpd-only trace: rocprofv3 writes OMPT records to the rocpd SQLite
# database (and they are exported to csv/perfetto/otf2 via `rocpd convert`). The
# direct json/csv/perfetto/otf2 generators do not contain OMPT records, so these
# validators read OMPT from the rocpd database.
#
# In rocpd, ranged OMPT operations are stored as named rows in the `regions` view
# and instantaneous operations (start == end, e.g. omp_parallel_begin) as named
# rows in the `samples` view. The `regions_and_samples` view unions both, so the
# OMPT operation set is queried from there. The "OMPT" category string is set in
# source/lib/output/domain_type.cpp.
