# Changelog for ROCprofiler-SDK

Full documentation for ROCprofiler-SDK is available at [rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/index.html)

## Unreleased

### Added

**API:**

- Late-start profiling support: Automatic profiling activation when rocprofiler-sdk loads after runtime initialization
  - `rocprofiler_force_configure()` now automatically detects and profiles runtimes that initialized before SDK load
  - Integrates with rocprofiler-register to retrieve already-registered API tables
  - Supports all runtime types (HSA, HIP, ROCTX, RCCL, ROCDecode, ROCJpeg, etc.) automatically
  - No explicit late-start API calls required - works transparently

**rocprofv3:**

- `--att --selected-regions` now enables marker-controlled device thread trace
  - Uses `roctxProfilerResume(0)` / `roctxProfilerPause(0)` to start and stop ATT collection at runtime
  - Supports multiple resume/pause cycles, each producing separate trace output files
  - Incompatible with `--att-consecutive-kernels`

**Documentation:**

- Added "Using Late-Loading" how-to guide with code examples
- Documented late-loading workflow and integration with rocprofiler-register
- Added marker-controlled thread tracing section to the thread trace how-to guide
- Added cross-reference from ROCTx documentation to ATT with selected-regions

### Changed

**Implementation:**

- **Late-start architecture redesign**: Removed direct runtime symbol access in favor of proper rocprofiler-register integration
  - Removed ~600 lines of dlopen/dlsym bypass logic
  - Replaced with ~80 lines calling `rocprofiler_register_invoke_all_registrations()`
  - Late-start now works by requesting rocprofiler-register to re-propagate stored API tables
  - Extensible design: automatically supports new runtimes without SDK code changes
  - Proper separation of concerns: rocprofiler-register manages table storage, SDK manages table wrapping

**Internal APIs (non-public):**

- Removed internal functions (were never in public headers):
  - `rocprofiler_start_late_internal()`
  - `rocprofiler_is_late_start_internal()`
  - `rocprofiler_stop_late_internal()`
- Replaced with single internal function: `rocprofiler::late_start::invoke_register_propagation()`

**Note:** Public API (`rocprofiler_force_configure()`) remains unchanged - no breaking changes for users

- Fixed `rocprofiler_*_id_t` structs for inconsistency related to a "null" handle:
  - The correct definition for a null handle is `.handle = 0` while some definitions previously used `UINT64_MAX`.
- Fixed kernel trace csv output generated by `rocpd`.

### Removed

- Support for compilation of gfx940 and gfx941 targets.


## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.1.0 for ROCm release 7.1

### Added
- Dynamic process attachment- ROCprofiler-sdk and `rocprofv3` now facilitate dynamic profiling of a running GPU applications by attaching to its process ID (PID), rather than launching the application through the profiler itself.
- Scratch-memory trace information to the Perfetto output in `rocprofv3`.
- New capabilities to the thread trace support in `rocprofv3`, including real-time clock support for thread trace alignment on gfx9 architecture. This enables high-resolution clock computation and better synchronization across shader engines. Additionally, `MultiKernelDispatch` thread trace support is now available across all ASICs.
- Documentation for dynamic process attachment.
- Documentation for `rocpd` summaries.


### Optimized
- Improved the stability and robustness of the `rocpd` output.

## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.1.0 for ROCm release 7.2

- Counter collection support for `gfx1150` and `gfx1151`.
- HSA Extension API v8 support.
- `hipStreamCopyAttributes` API implementation.
- `--profile-mpi-ranks` option in `rocprofv3` to selectively profile specific MPI ranks. Supports comma-separated ranges and individual ranks (e.g., `--profile-mpi-ranks 0-3,8,10-15`).

### Optimized

- Improved process attachment and updated the corresponding [documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/how-to/using-rocprofv3-process-attachment.html).
- Improved [Quick reference guide for rocprofv3] (https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/quick_guide.html).
- Updated installation documentation with links to the latest repository (https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/install/installation.html).

### Resolved issues
- Fixed multi-GPU dimension mismatch.
- Fixed device lock issue for dispatch counters.
- Addressed OpenMP Tools task scheduling null pointer exception.
- Fixed stream ID errors arising during process attachment.
- Fixed issues arising during dynamic code object loading.

## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.2.0 for ROCm release 7.3

### Added

- Multi-pass counter collection support in `rocprofv3`:
  - Support for multiple `--pmc` flags to define separate counter groups for different profiling passes
  - Ability to combine command-line `--pmc` flags with input file counter groups
  - Each pass generates output in a separate `pass_n` subdirectory
  - Example: `rocprofv3 --pmc SQ_WAVES --pmc GRBM_COUNT -- <app>` creates two profiling passes
- KFD (Kernel Fusion Driver) event tracing support:
  - Buffer service configurations for each KFD buffer tracing type
  - New type `tool_buffer_tracing_kfd_record_t` using `std::variant` to wrap 8 different KFD buffer tracing types
  - KFD record dumping to rocpd with support for 8 main KFD event types
  - Each KFD event generates `rocpd_info_pmc`, `rocpd_event`, `rocpd_region`, and `rocpd_pmc_event` rows
  - Support for rocpd to perfetto conversion for KFD events
  - `rocprofv3` `--kfd-trace` flag to enable KFD event tracing
  - Fixed handling for special SVM location in KFD prefetch location reporting
  - Fixed parsing for queue restore events to handle both correct format (character '0') and broken driver format (NULL character '\0')

### Changed

- Version updated to 1.2.0 to support better library compatibility detection for downstream dependencies
- Fixed rocpd OTF2 output to add ACCELERATOR_DEVICE as system tree node domain for AMD devices.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed `rocprofv3` input file parsing where comment lines containing `pmc:` were incorrectly processed as valid counter collection directives, causing unintended profiling passes.

### Removed
- Counter collection support for plain text (`.txt`) input files has been deprecated due to lack of schema validation and input sanitization. Only structured file formats (JSON and YAML) with schema validation are supported.

## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.3.0

### Added

- gfx1250 PMC support, including counter definitions and mappings for CHA, CHC, GLARBC, GL1A, GL1C, GRBMA, and GRBMH new blocks.

- gfx1250 stochastic PC sampling support:
  - gfx1250-specific parser with sample routing.
  - New stochastic sample fields: `sampling_lock_error`, `async_cnt`, `tensor_cnt`, `xnack_cnt`, and chiplet-aware metadata.
  - Memory dependency counters reveal per-wave memory latency.
  - Updated public PC sampling API structs and serialization for the new fields.
  - Kernel/IOCTL enablement and dedicated gfx1250 parser tests.

### Changed

- Counter dimension encoding changed from fixed-width to variable-width allocation per dimension type.
- Dimension selection and reduction logic now uses explicit dimension masks and single-index selection.
