# rocJPEG API Negative tests

This test suite is designed to perform negative testing on all rocJPEG APIs. The purpose of these tests is to validate the robustness and error-handling mechanisms of the rocJPEG APIs 
by providing invalid inputs, unexpected scenarios, or edge cases to ensure the APIs respond with appropriate error messages or behaviors.
