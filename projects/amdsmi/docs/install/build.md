# Build AMD SMI from source

To build AMD SMI as part of the ROCm Core SDK, see [TheRock build
instructions](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/docs/development/README.md).
TheRock is the recommended way to build ROCm components from source.

Alternatively, you can build AMD SMI standalone using the following
instructions.

(build_reqs)=
## Required software

To build the AMD SMI library, the following components are required. Note that
the software versions specified were used during development; earlier
versions are not guaranteed to work.

* CMake (v3.15.0 or later) -- `python3 -m pip install cmake`
* g++ (v5.4.0 or later)
* libdrm-dev (for Ubuntu and Debian)
* libdrm-devel (for RPM-based distributions)

In order to build the AMD SMI Python package, the following components are
required:

* Python (3.6.8 or later)
* virtualenv -- `python3 -m pip install virtualenv`

## Compiler requirements

AMD SMI automatically selects the best available Clang compiler in the following priority order:

1. **amdclang++** (recommended) - AMD's optimized Clang compiler from ROCm
2. **clang++** - ROCm clang++ or system clang++ (fallback)

**GCC is supported but not auto-selected.** To build with GCC, use a toolchain file (see below).

### How compilers are discovered

The build uses **`hipconfig --path`** for tool-based ROCm discovery.

**If ROCm is installed** (hipconfig found):
- Searches **ONLY in ROCm paths** for compilers (in order):
  1. `<rocm-path>/lib/llvm/bin/amdclang++` - Current standard location
  2. `<rocm-path>/llvm/bin/amdclang++` - Legacy symlink location
  3. `<rocm-path>/lib/llvm/bin/clang++` - ROCm clang++
  4. `<rocm-path>/llvm/bin/clang++` - ROCm clang++ (legacy)
- **Does NOT fall back to system clang++** - ensures ROCm compiler is used

**If ROCm is NOT installed** (hipconfig not found):
- Searches **ONLY in system PATH** for `clang++` (e.g., `/usr/bin/clang++`)
- This allows builds on systems without ROCm

**Note:** Hardcoded paths like `/opt/rocm` are intentionally not used to support multiple ROCm installations and relocatable builds.

## Build steps

1. Clone the rocm-systems repository to your local Linux machine
   and sparse-checkout the AMD SMI project.

   ```shell
   git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems.git
   git -C rocm-systems sparse-checkout set projects/amdsmi
   cd rocm-systems/projects/amdsmi
   ```

2. The default installation location for the library and headers is `/opt/rocm`.
   Before installation, any old ROCm directories should be deleted:

   * `/opt/rocm`
   * `/opt/rocm-<version_number>`

3. Build the library by following the typical CMake build sequence (run as root
   user or use `sudo` before `make install` command); for instance:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..          # Discovers ROCm and uses amdclang++
   make -j $(nproc)
   make install
   ```

   The built library is located in the  `build/` directory. To build the `rpm`
   and `deb` packages use the following command:

   ```bash
   make package
   ```

## Alternative compiler options

### Building with GCC

To build with GCC instead of amdclang++, use the provided toolchain file:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/amdsmi-gcc-toolchain.cmake
make -j $(nproc)
```

To use a specific GCC version, edit `cmake/toolchains/amdsmi-gcc-toolchain.cmake` or create your own toolchain file.

### Building with clang++

To use clang++ instead of amdclang++, explicitly specify the compiler with full path.

**Using ROCm's clang++:**

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/rocm-<version_number>/lib/llvm/bin/clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/rocm-<version_number>/lib/llvm/bin/clang
make -j $(nproc)
```

**Using system clang++:**

Requires clang to be installed (`sudo apt install clang` on Ubuntu/Debian).

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang
make -j $(nproc)
```

### Troubleshooting compiler detection

**If cmake fails with "amdclang++ not found":**

```bash
# Check if ROCm is installed and hipconfig is available
which hipconfig
hipconfig --path

# If hipconfig not found, add ROCm to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rocm/bin
cmake ..
```

**To check what compiler will be used:**

```bash
# Check available compilers
which amdclang++ clang++ g++ hipconfig

# Run cmake with verbose output
cmake .. -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
```


(rebuild_py_wrapper)=
## Rebuild the Python wrapper

The Python wrapper for the AMD SMI library is found in the [auto-generated
file](#py_lib_fs) `py-interface/amdsmi_wrapper.py`. It is essential to
regenerate this wrapper whenever there are changes to the C++ API. It is not
regenerated automatically.

To regenerate the wrapper, use the following command.

```shell
./update_wrapper.sh
```

After this command, the file in `py-interface/amdsmi_wrapper.py` will be updated
on compile.

```{note}
You need Docker installed on your system to regenerate the Python wrapper.
```

(build_tests)=
## Build the tests

To verify the build and capabilities of AMD SMI on your system, as well as to
see practical examples of its usage, you can build and run the available [tests
in the repository](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/develop/projects/amdsmi/tests).
Follow these steps to build the tests:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
make -j $(nproc)
```

(run_tests)=
### Run the tests

Once the tests are [built](#build_tests), you can run them by executing the
`amdsmitst` program. The executable can be found at `build/tests/amd_smi_test/`.

(build_docs)=
## Build the docs

The [C/C++ API reference](../reference/amdsmi-cpp-api/index.md) is generated
with [Doxygen 1.15.0](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/changelog.html#log_1_15_0),
which must be installed separately and available on your PATH.

1. Create a Python virtual environment and install documentation dependencies.

   ```bash
   # From rocm-systems/projects/amdsmi
   python3.12 -m venv docs/.venv
   source docs/.venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r docs/sphinx/requirements.txt
   ```

2. Use the following command to build the documentation using
   [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

   ```bash
   python -m sphinx docs docs/_build -j auto -E -v
   ```

3. Open `docs/_build/index.html` in your web browser to view the
   documentation. To serve the site locally instead, run:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server -d docs/_build
   # Go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser
   ```
