"""Runner hygiene: leaf tests must run only through their suite runner.

Executing a test file standalone -- via an ``if __name__ == "__main__":``
``unittest.main()`` block -- bypasses the shared runner (``common.run_test_dir``):
the root-privilege check, the ``sys.path`` / CLI resolution, the GTest-style
summary, and (most importantly) the ``sys.modules`` isolation guard that stops
one test class from polluting another. Every leaf test must instead be run
through its suite runner with a ``-k`` / ``-x`` filter, e.g.::

    unit_tests.py       -k "TestClass"               -v    # unit/
    cli_unit_test.py    -k "test_some_cli_behavior"  -v    # cli/
    integration_test.py -k "TestDiscovery"           -v    # functional/

This meta-test fails if any ``test_*.py`` module ships a standalone ``__main__``
runner, and names the runner that owns it.
