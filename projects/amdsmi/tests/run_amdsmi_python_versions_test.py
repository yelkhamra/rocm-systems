run_amdsmi_python_versions_test.py
==================================

The amdsmi loader and wrapper must behave identically across the range of
CPython versions AMD SMI supports (3.6.8 through the latest release). This
harness runs the version-independent loader contract tests under each
interpreter it is given, so a change that only breaks on, say, 3.6 or a newer
release is caught.

For each interpreter it:
  * confirms the wrapper imports and the loader resolves a path (or degrades to
    the _MissingLibrary sentinel without raising at import), and
  * runs the ABI-compat and dual-copy guard unit tests under that interpreter.

No GPU is required: the loader tests use a fake ctypes.CDLL.
