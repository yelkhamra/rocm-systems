run_amdsmi_dual_copy_test.py
============================

The system DEB/RPM installs the amdsmi Python module twice: once into the
interpreter's site-packages (so a bare ``import amdsmi`` works) and once under
``share/amd_smi`` (captured by the TheRock artifact flow and used by downstream
tools that ``sys.path.insert(ROCM_PATH + "/share/amd_smi")``). Both copies are
necessary -- TheRock ships only ``/opt/rocm`` and cannot reach the ``/usr``
site-packages tree, so a redirector/symlink is not an option.

Two independent copies can silently drift (a partial upgrade, a stray edit),
after which ``import amdsmi`` resolves to a different version depending on
sys.path order. This guard asserts the two installed copies are byte-identical
so any drift fails a build instead of shipping.

The bundled ``libamd_smi*.so`` is excluded from both install trees, so only the
Python sources are compared.
