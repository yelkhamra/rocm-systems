"""interconnect — XGMI / PCIe / NIC peak lookup tool.

Structured lookup for RCCL communication analysis. Returns per-arch vendor
IF/XGMI aggregate + per-link bandwidths, the PCIe tier, and an empirical
"achievable" RCCL AllReduce busBW number so the Latency Specialist can
classify bus-bandwidth efficiency.

Tool class: READ_ONLY (MCP-safe).

knowledge/interconnect_specs.yaml is the source of truth. Inter-node NIC
entries (e.g. "connectx7") live alongside the GPU keys and are selected
explicitly by the caller — there is no auto-detection.
