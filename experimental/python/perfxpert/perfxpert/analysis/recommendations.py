    Remove or trim recommendation commands whose flags are entirely covered
    by the data already present in the database.

    Rules:
    - A flag in ``already_collected`` is stripped from ``flags`` and from
      ``full_command``.
    - ``--pmc`` counter names are checked against ``"pmc:<NAME>"`` entries in
      ``already_collected`` (populated by ``_detect_already_collected``).
      Already-collected counters are removed from the ``--pmc`` arg value; if
      all counters in a ``--pmc`` arg are already present the arg (and flag)
      are dropped entirely.
    - If after stripping, a rocprofv3 command has no remaining flags AND
      its args contain only output-path or scope-filter entries (-d / -o /
      --kernel-include-regex / etc.), the command adds no new data and is dropped.
    - ``rocprof-sys --trace`` alone is equivalent to ``rocprofv3 --sys-trace``
      (same HIP/HSA API data, just in Perfetto format instead of rocpd format)
      and is dropped when sys-trace data is already present.  ``rocprof-sys``
      commands that carry *additional* flags beyond ``--trace`` (e.g.
      ``--trace-gpu-memory``, ``--call-stack-sampling``) are always kept
      because they collect data that rocprofv3 cannot.
    - ``rocprof-compute`` commands are always kept -- they perform a deep
      hardware counter analysis that neither rocprofv3 nor rocprof-sys covers.
    - A short note is appended to ``description`` when flags/counters are
      stripped so the user knows why the command looks different from the docs.
