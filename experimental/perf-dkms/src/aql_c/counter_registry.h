 * Event ID Constraints
 * ====================
 *
 * Hardware event IDs are 9-bit values programmed into counter SELECT registers.
 * Event IDs exceeding this limit will be silently truncated, causing incorrect
 * counter behavior or reading the wrong event.
 *
 * This limit is enforced at runtime in lookup_event_id() and should also be
 * validated at compile-time in architecture-specific event definition files.

 * Dimension Capability Flags
 * ===========================
 *
 * These flags indicate which hardware dimensions a performance counter supports.
 * Different counter types have different granularities:
 *
 * - GRBM counters: Global, no dimension support (DIM_NONE)
 * - SQ counters: Per shader engine/array/WGP (DIM_SE_SA_WGP)
 * - GL2C counters: Per shader engine/array (DIM_SE_SA)
 * - TA counters: Per shader engine/array/WGP (DIM_SE_SA_WGP)
 *
 * When a user specifies dimensions not supported by a counter, the event
 * creation will fail with an appropriate error message.
