/// **Single-threaded mode** (`num_threads == 1`): drains events directly from
/// the priority queue in timestamp order. No LBTS computation, no barriers,
/// no epoch structure. When the queue empties, drains async buffers and either
/// terminates or blocks on a condition variable for external events.
///
/// **Multi-threaded mode** (`num_threads > 1`): runs a conservative
/// barrier-based Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) loop. Each epoch:
///   1. Drain incoming cross-partition events + async events
///   2. Process events up to global_lbts
///   3. Publish local_next (earliest possible future activity)
///   4. Arrive at barrier (completion function computes new global_lbts)
///
/// Components participate in the simulation by scheduling events during
/// initialize() or startup(). Untimed (functional) components use the
/// Functional\<Base\> CRTP mixin, which self-schedules a timer callback and
/// re-enqueues after each step(). If no events are ever scheduled and no
/// primaries are registered, the simulation terminates via quiescence. If
/// primaries are registered, the engine blocks until async events arrive or
/// all primaries signal completion.

/// @code
///   SimulationEngine engine(config);
///   engine.topology().set_root(std::move(my_model));
///   engine.build(); // partitions, initializes components
///   // (user enqueues work via CP)
