# mirage

`mirage` is a user-facing UX (CLI + dashboard) for the [`rocjitsu`][rocjitsu]
GPU emulator and other emulator backends. It is designed so that:

* **All state lives on disk** in standard [XDG locations][xdg].  There is
  no required daemon to keep state alive — the CLI and the per-session
  host processes communicate exclusively through well-defined files.
* **Sessions are long-lived** processes that may host an emulator, manage
  containers, and shepherd the lifecycle of user execs (commands).
* **Execs are individual command invocations** within a session, with
  fully-redirected stdio (FIFO for stdin, a plain file for merged
  stdout/stderr) and a published per-node `pid`/`exit_code`.

This makes mirage easy to inspect (`ls`, `cat`, `tail -f`), easy to
script (`--json` on every list/show), and easy to recover from crashes
(restart the host; it picks up where it left off).

## Building

```sh
cargo build --workspace
```

Produces the unified `mirage` binary under `target/debug/`. The build
also compiles the embedded web dashboard, which needs **Node.js 20.19+**
and **npm** on your `PATH`.

See [`docs/building.md`](docs/building.md) for the full guide:
prerequisites (Rust, Node, optional rocjitsu/CMake), building the
dashboard SPA, building rocjitsu, environment variables, and
troubleshooting.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

The end-to-end tests in `tests/e2e.rs` cover the full lifecycle
(create session → start exec → attach → signal → stop) using only the
public CLI surface.
