/// Plugins receive callbacks at key points during simulation execution.
/// All hooks have empty default implementations so plugins only override
/// what they need. The no-plugin path has near-zero overhead (the
/// default empty group's delegation loops iterate an empty vector).
///
/// Ownership: plugins are owned by an ExecutionPluginGroup via
/// unique_ptr. The group itself is shared (via shared_ptr) between
/// the SoC and all components that fire hooks (CommandProcessor,
/// ComputeUnit, Hart). A static empty group is used as the default
/// so the plugin group pointer is never null.
