/// @brief Semantic translation for ISA-level behavioral differences.
///
/// @details Handles instructions and ABI conventions whose semantics change
/// across ISA generations, as opposed to the encoding translator which handles
/// pure binary format differences. Current semantic translations include:
///
/// - **Waitcnt lowering**: re-encode or conservatively expand a source
///   s_waitcnt when the host has a different wait-counter model.
/// - **Pair-specific instruction lowering**: MFMA→WMMA, AccVGPR elimination,
///   and other one-to-many target sequences. Kernel-entry descriptor ABI
///   prologues are built by KernelDescriptorTranslator and reached through a
///   CodeObjectPatcher descriptor-entry redirect.
///
/// The translator runs per instruction before the encoding translator. It
/// performs a binary search over the selected ISA-pair rule table, then invokes
/// the matched ExpandFn to produce replacement words that BinaryTranslator
/// writes in-place or through a code cave.
///
/// Rules are data-driven and live under code/dbt/semantic/. Adding a new
/// handwritten semantic rule means adding one entry to the relevant ISA-pair
/// table, not modifying BinaryTranslator's ISA-agnostic loop.
