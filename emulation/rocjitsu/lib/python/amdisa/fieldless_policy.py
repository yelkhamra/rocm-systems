"""Single source of truth for fieldless operand policy.

A fieldless operand (no ``<FieldName>`` in the MR ISA) has no encoding field to
decode; the generator constructs it from a canonical value and must decide how
it behaves at runtime, how it is classified, how it displays, and (later) which
architectural effect it represents. This module is one policy table: every
fieldless operand type maps to a single :class:`FieldlessPolicy` object whose
columns are

  * ``role``    -- coarse semantic category (:class:`FieldlessCategory`),
  * ``caps``    -- runtime capability for the normal read/write/SIMD accessors
                   (:class:`FieldlessCaps`),
  * ``display`` -- disassembly display policy (:class:`FieldlessDisplay`),
  * ``effect``  -- future architectural-effect metadata (stub; populated by the
                   special-register-effect slice).

    decide how to lower the operand; it is not emitted into C++.

    These map directly to construction-time capability flags on the C++
    ``Operand``; the normal read/write/SIMD accessors query the stored flags
    instead of re-deriving them from ``fieldless_`` plus operand type.

    Attributes:
        reads_value: The operand yields a real value through the normal read /
            SIMD accessors (``read_scalar``/``read_lane``/``simd_capable``/...).
            False means those accessors are inert (benign zero / no-op). Only
            the literal ``OPR_SIMM32`` reads a value today.
        writable: The operand is a valid write target for the normal write
            accessors. False for every fieldless operand today (no fieldless
            operand is a write/def target through the ordinary write path).

            placeholder, whose type is ``OPR_VGPR`` but which must NOT behave

    write helpers in ``isa_operand_simd_inl.h`` gate on ``reads_value()`` (not
    ``is_writable()``), so a writable-or-VGPR operand that does not read a value
    would silently bypass the SIMD write path. ``__post_init__`` enforces this.
